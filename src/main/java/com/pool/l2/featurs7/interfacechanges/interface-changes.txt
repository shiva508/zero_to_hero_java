--->In Java SE 7 or earlier versions, an interface can have only two kinds of things.

	a).Constant variables
	b).Abstract methods
--->We couldnâ€™t provide method implementations in interfaces. 
	If we want to provide the combination of abstract methods 
	and non-abstract methods (methods with implementation), 
	we had to go for abstract class only.

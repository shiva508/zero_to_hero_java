--->Oracle Corp has introduced some convenient factory methods to create Immutable List, 
	Set, Map and Map.Entry objects. These utility methods are used to create empty or 
	non-empty Collection objects.
--->In Java SE 8 and earlier versions, We can use Collections class utility methods 
	like unmodifiableXXX to create Immutable Collection objects. For instance, 
	if we want to create an Immutable List, then we can use Collections.unmodifiableList method.
--->However, these Collections.unmodifiableXXX methods are a tedious and verbose approach. 
	To overcome those shortcomings, Oracle Corp has added a couple of utility methods to List, 
	Set and Map interfaces.
--->List and Set interfaces have “of()” methods to create an empty or no-empty Immutable 
	List or Set objects as shown below:


List.of()
Set.of()
Map.of()
to create immutable list of values

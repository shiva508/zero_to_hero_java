-->java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue is a java Queue that support operations that wait for the queue 
to become non-empty when retrieving and removing an element, and wait for space to become available 
in the queue when adding an element.
-->Java BlockingQueue doesnâ€™t accept null values and throw NullPointerException if you try to store 
null value in the queue.
-->Java BlockingQueue implementations are thread-safe. All queuing methods are atomic in nature and 
use internal locks or other forms of concurrency control.
-->Java provides several BlockingQueue implementations such as ArrayBlockingQueue,
 LinkedBlockingQueue, PriorityBlockingQueue, SynchronousQueue

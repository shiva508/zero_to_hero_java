PriorityBlockingQueue: It is to be noted that both the implementations, the PriorityQueue and 
LinkedList are not thread-safe. PriorityBlockingQueue is one alternative implementation if 
thread-safe implementation is needed. PriorityBlockingQueue is an unbounded blocking queue 
that uses the same ordering rules as class PriorityQueue and supplies blocking retrieval operations. 
Since it is unbounded, adding elements may sometimes fail due to resource exhaustion resulting 
in OutOfMemoryError. Letâ€™s see how to create a queue object using this class.

@Java List
-->In Java, the List interface is an ordered collection that allows us to store and access elements sequentially. It extends the Collection interface.

@Classes that Implement List
-->Since List is an interface, we cannot create objects from it.
-->In order to use functionalities of the List interface, we can use these classes:

ArrayList
LinkedList
Vector
Stack

@Java List vs. Set
-->Both the List interface and the Set interface inherits the Collection interface. However, there exists some difference between them.

-->Lists can include duplicate elements. However, sets cannot have duplicate elements.
-->Elements in lists are stored in some order. However, elements in sets are stored in groups like sets in mathematics.

-->A blocking queue is a queue that blocks when you try to dequeue from it and the queue is empty, 
   or if you try to enqueue items to it and the queue is already full. A thread trying to dequeue from an 
   empty queue is blocked until some other thread inserts an item into the queue. 
--> A thread trying to enqueue an item in a full queue is blocked until some other thread makes space in the queue, 
    either by dequeuing one or more items or clearing the queue completely.

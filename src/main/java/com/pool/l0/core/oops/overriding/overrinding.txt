1.What is overriding?
Ans:
When child class has the same methods as parent class has then it is known as method overriding
or 
If child class provide implementation for methods declared in parent class then it is known method overriding
2.Where do we use overriding?
Ans:
Method overriding is used to provide different implementation for method which is declared in parent class
Method overriding Used for runtime polymorphism 
3.Rules for method overriding
Ans:
method name and number of parameters passing in child and parent class should be same
Child class shoud be inherited from parent class 
Return type should be same for both parent class method and child class method
4.What is printed when we assign child class object to parent class reference ?
Ans:
It calls method in child class 
4.What is printed when we assign parent class object to child class reference ?
Ans:
Can not assign parent class object to child class reference

5.Can we override static method?
Ans:
No, a static method cannot be overridden. It can be proved by runtime polymorphism
If we try to override them they will be hidden in the sub class.
6.Why can not override static methods?
because the static method is bound with class whereas instance method is bound with an object.
Static belongs to the class area, and an instance belongs to the heap area. 
7.What happens if we change the arguments of overriding method? 
Ans:
If we change parameters it becomes method overloading
8.Can we override protected method of super class as public method in the sub class?
yes 
9.Can we override main method
Ans:
No miain method is static 
10.Can we change the return type of overriding method from Number type to Integer type?
Ans:
You can change as Integer is a sub class of Number type.
